Javascript Module Exercises

1.  Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it): 
	x = 1;  var a = 5;   var b = 10;  
	var c = function(a, b, c) {    
		document.write(x);    // => undefined
		document.write(a);    // => 8
		var f = function(a, b, c) {
			b = a;       
			document.write(b);   // => 8
 			b = c;       
			var x = 5;     
		}    
		f(a,b,c);    
		document.write(b);   // => 9
		var x = 10;     
	} 
	c(8,9,10); 
	document.write(b); // => 10
	document.write(x);  // => 1

2.  Define Global Scope and Local Scope in Javascript. 
	- Global scope is global environment for functions, vars, etc. 
	- Local Scope is scope inside the function including nested variables, objects, methods, etc.
 
3.   Consider the following structure of Javascript code: 
 
	// Scope A  
	function XFunc () {   
		// Scope B   
		function YFunc () {    
			// Scope C   
		};  
	}; 
 
(a) Do statements in Scope A have access to variables defined in Scope B and C? 
	=> No
(b) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope A? 
	=> Yes
(c) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope C? 
	=> No
(d) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope A? 
	=> Yes
(e) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope B? 
 	=> Yes.
