Javascript Scope Exercises
1.  Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it): 
	x = 1;  var a = 5;   var b = 10;  
	var c = function(a, b, c) {    
		var x = 10;    
		document.write(x);   // => 10
		document.write(a);    // => 8
		var f = function(a, b, c) {       
			b = a;       
			document.write(b);    // => 8   
			b = c;       
			var x = 5;      
		}   
 		f(a,b,c);    
		document.write(b);     // => 9
	} 
	c(8,9,10); 
	document.write(b); // => 10
	document.write(x);   // => 1 
 
2.  What is the difference between a method and function? 
 	- Method: is a function of a local object.
	- Function: First-class functions(global)
		- Functions can be assigned to variables.
		- Functions can be passed as parameters
		- Functions can be return values


3.  What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method? 
 	“This” in Java refer to instance of the current object which newly created by invoke constructor method.
	The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

4.  What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method? 
 	=> 'this' inside the method refer to its object.

5.  What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function? 
  	=> The keyword 'this' inside the constructor function points to the newly created object.

6.  Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to? 
 	=>  'this' refer to object x

7.  What is a free variable in JavaScript? 
 	=> A variable referred to by a function that is not one of its parameters or local variables

8.  Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function  that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal. 
 var object = {
	'name': 'fred',
	'major': 'music',
	'method': function(x, y){
		if(x === y){ return x*y;}
		else {
			return Math.min(x, y);
		}
	}
}

9.  Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields:  name, salary, position. 

function Employee(name, salary, position){
	this.name = name;
	this.salary = salary;
	this.position = position;
	}
var employee1 = new Employee(“Ken”, 1000, “Programmer”);
var employee2 = new Employee(“Vin”, 2000, “Leader”);
var employee3 = new Employee(“Nguyen”, 3000, “Manager”);

 
10.  Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the arguments. 

function(){
	let sum=0;
	for(let i = 0; i < arguments.lenght; i++){
		sum += arguments[i];
	}
}
 
11.  Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
	var max = (x, y, z) => Math.max(x, Math.max(y, z));
