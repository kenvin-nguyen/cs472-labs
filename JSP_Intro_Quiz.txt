 JSP Introduction Quiz
1. What is the main value of Java Server Pages?
- separate display from processing, i.e., separate html from java

2. How are JSP pages related to servlets?
- A JSP life cycle can be defined as the entire process from its creation till its destruction, similar to the servlet life cycle with an additional step of compiling a JSP into servlet.
- JSP are translated to Servlets when the page is accessed for the first time

3. How are JSP pages related to HTML?
- JSP is a technology that allows you to write dynamic HTTP response with static data mixed with dynamic data with special tags.
- JSP is a html based code.

4. Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- JSP scriplet:
    <% sum = a + b; %>
- JSP servlet:
    public void _jspService(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request,
                        javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response)
                throws javax.servlet.ServletException,
                        java.io.IOException {
        …
        int sum = a + b;
        …
    }

5. Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- JSP scriplet:
    <%! int sum = 0; %>
- JSP servlet:
    int sum = 0;
    
    public void _jspService(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request,
                        javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response)
                throws javax.servlet.ServletException,
                        java.io.IOException {
        …
        sum = a + b;
    }

6. Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- JSP scriplet:
	<%-- Calculate sum of two numbers --%>
- JSP servlet:
	public void _jspService(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request,
                        javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response)
                 throws javax.servlet.ServletException,
                        java.io.IOException {
		PrintWrite out = response.getWrite();
        out.println("");
	}
7. Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- JSP scriplet:
	<%= a + b %>
- JSP servlet:
	public void _jspService(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request,
                        javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response)
                 throws javax.servlet.ServletException,
                        java.io.IOException {
		…
		PrintWrite out = response.getWrite();
		out.println(a + b)
	}

8. Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- JSP scriplet:
	<%@ page import=”java.util.Date”%>
- JSP servlet:
    	import java.util.Date;

	public void _jspService(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request,
                        javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response)
                 throws javax.servlet.ServletException,
                        java.io.IOException {
		…
		PrintWrite out = response.getWrite();
		out.println(a + b)
	}

9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.
${something}
- EL expression is evaluated as follows:
	- checks page scope for an attribute named "something" -> if found use it
	- otherwise check request scope for an attribute named "something" -> if found use it
	- otherwise check session scope for an attribute named "something" -> if found use it
	- otherwise check application scope for an attribute named "something" -> if found use it
	- otherwise ignore the expression

10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.
${firstThing}
	- if firstThing is not an implicit EL object, then search page,
	request, session and application scopes until attribute
	"firstThing" is found
	${firstThing.secondThing}
		- if firstThing is a bean then secondThing is a property of the bean
		- if firstThing is a map then secondThing is a key of the map
	${firstThing[secondThing]}
		- if firstThing is a bean then secondThing is a property of the bean
		- if firstThing is a map then secondThing is a key of the map
		- if firstThing is a List then secondThing is an index into the List

11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact.
- From JSP page: can invoke a servlet from a JSP page through the jsp:include and jsp:forward action tags
    Example:
	< jsp:include page="/servlet/AServlet" flush="true" />
        < jsp:forward page="/servlet/AServlet" />
 
- From Servlet: through functionality of the standard javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher interface
    Example:
	RequestDispatcher rd = sc.getRequestDispatcher("/jsp/mypage.jsp");
	rd.include(request, response);
	or:
        rd.forward(request, response);
