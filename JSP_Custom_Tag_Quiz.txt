JSP Custom Tags Quiz
 
1. Rewrite the JSP page in the first demo (forEach) to use scripting instead of the JSTL forEach. 
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %> <html>
<head><title>Weather Page</title>
</head> 
<body> <%String[][] data = {{"Nov 6", "32", "26"},{"Nov 7", "32", "26"},{"Nov 8", "32", "26"}}; request.setAttribute(“temperatures", data);%> 
 
<table> 
<tr>
	<th>DATE</th>
	<th>HIGH</th>
	<th>LOW</th>
</tr> 
<c:forEach var=“daily" items="${temperatures}">     
<tr>         
	<td>${daily[0]}</td><td>${daily[1]}</td>
	<td>${daily[2]}</td>     
</tr> 
</c:forEach> 
</table>
</body>
</html> 

2. How do custom tags relate to JSTL?  
	- JSTL is a standard library of JSP actions, but JSP allows developers to create their own actions.
	- Component development creates custom functionality that can be packaged and reused by content developers.
	- Almost every modern web app framework relies heavily on the use of such components.

3. What is the role of the URI in the TLD and the taglib directive?  
	- The uri attribute value resolves to a location the container understands and the prefix attribute informs a container what bits of markup are custom actions

4. What is a tag handler class? 
	- Handler class that implements the tag functionality.

5. What is the role of attribute setters in a tag handler class?  
	- To set value for each attribute of custom tag.

6. What is the role of the doTag() method in a tag handler class?  
	- Render custom tag.

7. What does the operation getJspContext().getOut().write(“Hi Bob”) do when called in a doTag() method?  
	- Print out the value of customtag attributes.

8. What does the operation getJspBody().invoke(null) do when called in a doTag() method?
	- When getJspBody().invoke(null) is called, it is the output resulting from the execution of the tag body's JSP content that gets passed to the client, not the JSP code itself.
